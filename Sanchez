## Section 2: What do we do
As an Agile Wizard, we coach enterprises on adopting an Agile mindset in their organization. We were very young
when we started our career. We have seen and experienced multiple agile adoption attempts from an employee perspective
on different positions within multiple enterprises. Having worked in support, development, automation, analyses and security in
different roles. We lived through the different pain points every position has to go through when adopting an Agile mindset across the organization. As a certified Agile coach, it is my goal to aid you through this adventure and give you a chance on your best possible outcome.

# Workshops

Same header as main page

Here should be a list of all different workshops someone can order. DO note: This is not a webshop, it is a page
where people can see all workshops and when they click one they are reffered to a page that shows more details.
At the end of that detail page there will be a contact form.

Same footer as main page
I do not know if it might be a good idea, but we could include the contact form on all pages? So making the contact form part of the footer might be a better idea instead of managing an enourmous amount of footers?

# Detailed workshop page

## Identity and Access management Scrum master

Same headers as main page, I assume this will happen from now on for all pages that will exist on this web page and I will not have to repeat this every time.
I want to put an image on the top of every workshop or this specific page. I just don't know yet what to put. Here is an example image.

![[Agile-coach-AI-image-identity-and-access-management-image.png]]
As an Identity and Access management Scrum master, I want to help your organization become more Agile in your Security department. Specifically for your Identity and access management tribe or squad. The benefits this brings for you are:
- A scrum master who is also an Agile coach, who can guide throughout all phases of the Agile transformation
- A scrum master who has a technical background in Infrastructure, which is important for potential discussions when managing identities
- A scrum master who has a technical background in Security, which is important for potential discussions regarding provisioning and managing identities the right way
- A scrum master who lived through the pain points of the Identity and Access management squad and can coach both the Product owner and squad members for becoming more Agile
- A scrum master that can coach individuals on a one-on-one basis
- A scrum master that assists the Product Owner in reaching their goals. For example:
	- Increase predictability rate
	- Increase workflow
	- Manage flow load
	- Stabilizes flow velocity
	- Coaches flow distribution
	- Decrease amount of impediments
	- Increase transparency
	- Visualize dashboards based on data and important metrics (FE: in Jira)
	- Reaching a set goal that is realistic
	- Enable them to forecast incoming work
	- Lead ceremonies that aid in prioritization
	- Define KPI's or OKR's that aid the Agile transition
	- Helps with employee engagement and psychological safety
	- Guiding through failure
	- Increase autonomy
	- Increase laughter in the squad
	- Focus on customer value
	- Aligning stakeholders
	- Backlog changes through customer feedback
	- ...
- A scrum master that facilitates the daily standup ceremony
- A scrum master that facilitates the Product Backlog refinement
- A scrum master that facilitates the Sprint review ceremony
- A scrum master that facilitates the Retrospective ceremony
- A scrum master that facilitates the sprint planning
- A scrum master that aids in PI planning

### Section - That is not all
As an Agile coach, we are aware the above description is the job description of a scrum master. In the end, the product owner might not know what specific metrics they would use, or what ceremonies they need to apply. Mostly they have a goal that says something like:
- We need to be 5 percent more ecological
- We need to save 150.000 euro per year
- We need to increase customer satisfaction with 5 percent.
- ...
Whatever goal you need to reach as an Identity and Access management product owner, as an Identity and Access management scrum master I will use Agile practices to enable your goal achievement. Through coaching practices the team receives the highest possible chance on becoming self-managed. Therefore there will be an eventual end date to this service as the scrum master will most likely be replaced by someone internal or is not needed anymore for your specific project.

### Section - Practically how does this service work?

This service is a full time service that is billed on a time and materials basis. I will become part of your team and together with your organization we will pave the road to achieving your goal. If you are interested, you can use the contact form below so we can schedule a meeting to talk about what you would like to achieve and pricing.

Take note that most projects of this caliber last between 1.5 - 5 years and as this is on a full time basis, we cannot always help you immediately. This is because one client might have multiple projects they require a scrum master to help them become more Agile.

For a faster response, you can check out our work shops which are fixed price (based on your choices) and are focused on specific Agile topics.

### Section - Contact Form
Here the contact form for this specific workshop. I need to know if someone sent me an email, from which page he came. This does not have to be subject, but can also be body.

## Workshop combo - Prioritizing your work effectively + The goal of stories

As an Agile coach who teaches Scrum practices, I want to effectively teach you how to prioritize your work effectively. In combination with this workshop I recommend to also do "The goal of stories" workshop as they both give your organization a solid foundation on how to continue forward with your work. When doing this workshop you do not have to have prior experience to Scrum as this will be partially explained during the workshop. If you have experience with Scrum we will spend time using what you have learned on the actual data you have.

The benefits this brings you are:
- Learn what Scrum is and how this will make your organization more effective
- Get guidance on how to talk to your other squad members and give great estimates on the work you are about to do
- Understand the goal of user stories and how to utilize them the right way
- Find out the benefit from sitting together vs writing long documentation requirements through an interactive game.
- Participate in the benefits of relative estimations vs absolute estimations
- Be able to use a technique for estimations using the Fibonacci sequence.
- Plan ahead in time so you know what workload is coming towards your squad.
- Prioritize the work that is most beneficial to your squad or organization vs trying to do everything at once.
- Listen to the way your colleagues think and come to new understandings through interactive games
- Have a personalized workshop based on your organizations needs.
- Have an Agile coach present who cannot only answer Scrum related questions, but also questions how to incorporate this in your Agile transition.
- When there is time left, we can go over practical examples within your organization and apply the theory to practice immediatly.

### Section - That is not all
This combo / individual workshop can be ordered again for your specific squad. Instead of getting just the theory, we will go through the data you have OR help you build a way of working to apply the specific skill with actual data from your organization. Contact us through the contact form at the bottom of this page.

### Section - Practically how does this work?
This workshop is a fixed time service. Depending on the size of your team, one workshop can last from 2-3.5 hours. Since this is a combo package, the workshop will be 4-7 hours long.

We can do this workshop in 3 formats:
- Physical on location within your organization
- Remote over Teams or Google meet
- Physical on location somewhere outside of your organization

We can also do this workshop in 2 themes:
- Business casual themed (like any workshop you have ever attended to)
- Dungeons and Dragons themed (like the Table Top Role Playing game)
